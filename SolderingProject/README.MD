# Rambam RamBots LED Badge

- Install Arduino IDE (1.8.* preferred).
- Install ATTiny84 core.
- Buy or build an ATTiny programmer. I use the [Tiny AVR Programmer](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11801) from [Sparkfun](https://www.sparkfun.com/).
- Assemble the board. The power requirements are 5v, so two cells will be too much. I never redid the board with a diode to limit 6v -> 5v.
