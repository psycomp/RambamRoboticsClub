# Rambam RamBots LED Badge

- Assemble the board. The ATTiny chip is pre-programmed, but, you can...
  - Install Arduino IDE (1.8.* preferred).
  - Install [ATTiny84 core](https://cyberblogspot.com/how-to-install-attinycore-on-arduino-ide/).
  - Buy or build an ATTiny programmer. I use the [Tiny AVR Programmer](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11801) from [Sparkfun](https://www.sparkfun.com/). An Arduino can be wired as a programmer.
  - Install the Charlieplex library in this repo, and load Examples->Charlieplex->Charlieplex
- Power the board. Two button cells (about 5v) is over spec for the ATTiny, but it's worked fine for me.
